# Source Codes for Neural Stochastic Contraction Metric (NSCM)
Welcome to our NSCM python package for real-time robust nonlinear estimation and control via convex optimization for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems. We also recommend to visit our [Neural Contraction Metric (NCM)](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm) python package for details (see also [the NCM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04361)).
### NCM class automatically computes
* optimal, provably-stable, robust, and real-time state estimation and control policies of a given nonlinear dynamical system
* [Neural Contraction Metrics (NCMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04361)
### Given the following parameters
* nonlinear dynamical system : f of dx/dt = f(x)+g(x)u
* measurement equation (for state estimation) : h of y = h(x)
* actuation matrix (for feedback control) : g of dx/dt = f(x)+g(x)u
* state space of your interest
## What are [Neural Contraction Metrics (NCMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04361)?
This repository contains the [NCM class](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/wiki/Documentation) file which automatically constructs an NCM of a given nonlinear dynamical system, and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) examples for [estimation](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/blob/master/NCMestimation.ipynb) and [control](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/blob/master/NCMcontrol.ipynb) of perturbed nonlinear dynamical systems using an NCM introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04361). Here are some important facts about the NCM.
1. The NCM is a global neural network-based approximation of an optimal contraction metric.
2. The existence of a contraction metric is a necessary and sufficient condition for exponential stability of nonlinear systems. 
3. The optimality of NCMs stems from the fact that the contraction metrics sampled offline are the solutions of a convex optimization problem (see [CV-STEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04359) for more details) to minimize an upper bound of the steady-state Euclidean distance between perturbed and unperturbed system trajectories.
4. Due to the differential formulation of contraction analysis, there exists a nonlinear version of estimation and control duality, analogous to the one of the Kalman filter and LQR duality in linear systems (see the [NCM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04361) for more).
5. Note that the NCM class file assumes input affine autonomous nonlinear systems, but you can always convert input non-affine non-autonomous systems into an input affine autonomous form by treating t as a state variable and du/dt as a control input.

### Required software
In addition to standard python packages like numpy, you need several other packages and software. The NCM class file [classncm.py](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/blob/master/classncm.py) has been verified to work with CVXPY 1.1.1, Mosek 9.2.11, TensorFlow 2.2.0, and Keras 2.3.1.

* [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/install/index.html) and [Mosek](https://docs.mosek.com/9.2/install/installation.html) to solve convex optimization problems
* [Keras](https://keras.io/about/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) to construct neural networks (Keras comes packaged with TensorFlow 2.0 as tensorflow.keras)

* your guess of contraction rate : just put a small number if not sure
## Quick guide to [classncm.py](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/blob/master/classncm.py)
The detailed explanation on its methods and objects are given in [the documentation](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/wiki/Documentation). Here we introduce some useful methods for the NCM design. The trade-off between larger feedback gains (larger nu) and smaller steady-state tracking error (smaller chi) discussed in the NCM paper can be handled by changing the values d1_over and d2_over in the NCM class.
* **[ncm](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/wiki/NCM-methods:-ncm)** : Returns a trained NCM with respect to a given state.
* **[train](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/wiki/NCM-methods:-train)** : Trains a neural network to be used for designing an NCM and returns a Keras neural network model.
* **[cvstem](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/wiki/NCM-methods:-cvstem)** : Samples optimal contraction metrics of a given dynamical system in a given state space by the [CV-STEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04359) method. These metrics will be used for the neural network training in the train method.
* **[linesearch](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/wiki/NCM-methods:-linesearch)** : Finds the optimal contraction rate by line search.
* **[simulation](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/wiki/NCM-methods:-simulation)** : Performs NCM-based estimation or control of a given nonlinear dynamical systems and returns simulation results.
## [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/wiki/Have-some-issues-with-the-NCM-package%3F)
The convex optimization problem in the [cvstem](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/wiki/NCM-methods:-cvstem) method could become infeasible for some nonlinear dynamical systems under certain choices of parameters. Here are some tips in avoiding such infeasibility in practice.
* **Start from smaller value of alpha** : Since the stability constraint becomes tighter as alpha (contraction rate) becomes larger, set alims[0] (minimum alpha) smaller.
* **Select smaller state space** : Since larger state space could lead to stricter stability constraints, set xlims to represent smaller state space.
* **Use larger CV-STEM sampling period** : It is better to use a smaller CV-STEM sampling period dt when computing dW/dt (W: normalized inverse of a contraction metric) from a theoretical point of view, but it could cause some numerical issues. You can relax dt to some larger values.
* **Write your dynamics in state-dependend coefficient form** : The NCM class uses Jacobian of f(x) and h(x) for parameters Afun and Cfun by default. Instead you could use extended linearization, i.e. use A(x) and C(x) s.t. f(x) = A(x)x and h(x) = C(x)x for Cfun and Afun. See the [CV-STEM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04359) for more.
* **Pre-compute xd and ud** : For some systems, a feedback control law u = -K(x)x is not sufficient to stabilize them in practice. You could try u = -K(x)(x-xd)+ud instead using a pre-computed desired trajectory and input xd and ud.
* **Change d1_over and d2_over from their default values** : Although this will not affect the infeasibility theoretically, it may solve some numerical issues.
* **Try different solvers** : The default solver for the NCM class is [Mosek](https://docs.mosek.com/9.2/install/installation.html). You can change "solver=cp.MOSEK" in the class file to [something different such as cp.CVXOPT](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html).
* **Solve CV-STEM problems along pre-computed trajectories** : The NCM class computes dW/dt (W: normalized inverse of a contraction metric) using a lower bound of the induced 2-norm of a contraction metric. You could run the CV-STEM along given trajectories as was done in the [NCM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04361) seeking for a less tight stability condition. The [source codes of this paper](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/tree/master/sourcecodes) will give you some ideas.
* **Set epsilon to some positive value** : There is a parameter called epsilon in the NCM class, and if you select epsilon > 0 then the stability condition can be relaxed. You could also use epsilon as a decision variable and minimize it to have tightest relaxation but stability in a sense described in the [NCM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04361) is no longer guaranteed.
* **Try [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/) if you have [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)** : The [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/) can sometimes obtain optimal solutions even when the solvers in [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/install/index.html) fail. We have a [matlab version of the NCM class](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm/blob/master/NCM.m) although it is under development.
